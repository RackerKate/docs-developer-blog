This two-part blog post series covers the new performance-tuning features of Oracle databases 12.1.0.1 and 12.1.0.2. Part 1 covers Oracle database version 12.1.0.1.

### New Features in Oracle Database 12.1.01:

The following features are new in Oracle database version 12.1.0.1:

- Real-Time Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM)
- Limiting the size of the Program Global Area (PGA)
- Active Session History (ASH) Enhancements

#### Real-Time ADDM

Real-Time ADDM helps you analyze and resolve problems in hung databases without having the database restart. In Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) 12c, it helps you analyze and resolve problems.

##### Real-time ADDM connection modes

When connecting to the database by using OEM, Real-Time ADDM uses two different connection modes, depending on the database state:

- **Normal connection**: In this mode, Real-Time ADDM performs a normal Java
  Database Connectivityâ€¯(JDBC) to the database. This mode performs an
  extensive performance analysis of the database when some connectivity is
  available.

- **Diagnostic connection**: In this mode, Real-Time ADDM performs a
  latch-less connection to the database. This mode is used in for extreme hang
  situations when a normal JDBC connection is not possible.

##### Real-Time ADDM Triggers

Real-Time ADDM runs automatically every three seconds and uses in-memory data to diagnose any performance issues in the database. Real-Time ADDM automatically triggers an analysis when it detects a performance problem:

1. Every three seconds, the manageability monitor process (MMON) performs an
   action to obtain performance statistics without lock or latch.

2. The MMON process checks these statistics and triggers a Real-Time ADDM
   analysis if any of the issues listed in Table A.1 are found.

3. The MMON slave process creates the report and stores it in the Automatic
   Workload Repository (AWR). For more details, you can check the
   `DBA_HIST_REPORTS` and `DBA_HIST_REPORTS_DETAILS` views.

You can also use the following command to manually generate a report:

    SQL> select dbms_addm.real_time_addm_report() from dual;

Table A.1 lists the issues and conditions that trigger a Real-Time ADDM
analysis:

| Issue | Condition |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High load | Average active sessions are greater than three times the number of CPU cores |
| I/O bound | I/O impact on active sessions based on single block read performance |
| CPU bound | Active sessions are greater than 10% of total load and CPU utilization is greater than 50% |
| Over-allocated memory | Memory allocations are over 95% of physical memor |
| Interconnect bound | Based on single block interconnect transfer time |
| Session limit | Session limit is close to 100% |
| Process limit | Process limit is close to 100% |
| Hung session | Hung sessions are greater than 10% of total sessions |
| Deadlock detected | Any deadlock is detected |

##### Real-Time ADDM Trigger Controls

To ensure that the automatic triggers don't consume too many system
resources, Real-Time ADDM deploys the following controls:

- **Duration Between Reports**: If a Real-Time ADDM report was created in the
  past five minutes by the automatic trigger, then no new reports are
  generated.

- **Oracle RAC Control**: Automatic triggers are local to the database
  instance. For Oracle RAC, only one database instance can create a Real-Time
  ADDM report at a given time.

- **Repeated Triggers**: An automatic trigger for any issue must have an
  impact of 100% or higher than the previous report with the same triggering
  issue within the past 45 minutes.

- **Newly Identified Issues**: If a new issue is detected which was not
  previously detected within the past 45 minutes, then a new report is
  generated.

##### Limiting the size of the Program Global Area (PGA)

Excessive PGA usage can lead to high rates of swapping. When this occurs, the
system might become unresponsive and unstable. In this happens, consider using
the `PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT` initialization parameter to limit overall PGA usage.

The following section describes how to limit the size of the PGA by using the
`PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT` initialization parameter in Oracle Database 12c R1
(12.1.0.1) and higher.

**About the `PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT` parameter**

If the value defined in the `PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT` parameter is exceeded,
Oracle Database aborts or terminates the sessions or processes that are
consuming the most untunable PGA memory. It performs the termination in the
following order:

- Calls for sessions that are consuming the most untunable PGA memory and
  aborts them.
- If PGA memory usage is still over the `PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT`, then Oracle
  Database terminates the sessions and processes that are consuming the most
  untunable PGA memory.

Oracle Database treats parallel queries as a single unit. By default, the
`PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT` parameter is set to the greater of 2 GB, 200% of the
`PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET` value, or 3 MB times the value of the `PROCESSES`
parameter. However, it does not exceed 120% of the physical memory size minus
the total SGA size.

**Setting `PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT`**

The `PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT` initialization parameter can be set dynamically. The database doesn't need to restart. You can set the value of `PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT` regardless of whether Oracle Database is using automatic memory management.

**Changing the `PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT`**

Set the `PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT` initialization parameter to a new value in
number of bytes. Setting the value to `0` disables the hard limit on PGA
memory.

When the `PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT` is exceeded, Oracle Database performs the
following actions:

- Aborts the calls that are associated with the sessions that are using the
  most untunable memory.
- If the total PGA memory usage is still over the limit, terminates the
  sessions that are using the most untunable memory.

sys.processes and background processes other than job queue processes aren't
affected. Instead, if they're using the most untunable memory, they
periodically write a brief summary of their PGA usage to a trace file.

#### Active Session History enhancements

As of Oracle 12c, you can access Active Session History (ASH) data
visualization through a new OEM page named _ASH Analytics_. This page enables
you to drill down into logical dimensions. You can also send the reports to
others users who can view them offline.

### Conclusion

These new features collectively helps you troubleshoot and enhance database
performance for 12cR1 versions. Part 2 of this series covers more new features
and changes to performance tuning in Oracle Database 12.1.0.2.
